# citygen-godot

Source code for the interactive procedural city generation algorithm described [here](http://tmwhere.com/city_generation.html), ported to Godot 3 using GDScript. This fork makes some minor API changes to work with Godot 4.2.

## Structure

- `Main` node coordinates the other classes and does some simple drawing.
- `CityGen` node contains the city generation algorithm. The size of the city can be customized using the `segment_count_limit` in the inspector for the node.
- `PopulationHeatmap` node generates the population heatmap that influences the density of the generated city. The noise used for the heatmap can be customized in the inspector for the node.

`city_gen.gd` can be easily copied out for use in other projects, since its only dependency is the `PopulationHeatmap` node.
